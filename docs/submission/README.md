# Starbucks Offer Engine

The project is about creating an offer recommendation engine for the Starbucks
marketing team. Every few days, Starbucks is sending out offers to users of the
mobile app. There are mainly three main types of offers: discount, BOGO (buy one get one) and informational offers. Not all Starbucks customers receive the same offer. 

The problem of the project is to find a solution that will take customer
attributes and offer attributes into account and suggest if the offer will be
successful or not. By doing so Starbucks team will be able to check to which
offer a customer will respond. By finding the right offer for the right customer
Starbucks will be able to increase the marketing ROI. Also Starbucks will be
able to target only customers that will respond to the offers, instead of
sending the same offer to everyone and customers may become annoyed by
Starbucks's advertising.
